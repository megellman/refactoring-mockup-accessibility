# Refactoring Mockup Accessibility
![project landing page](/assets/images/mockup-page-screenshot.png)

## Description
This project was created to practice refactoring code to ensure that it meets accessibility standards. It's important to ensure that websites are accessible so that everyone, including people with disabilities, are able to access the information. 

To meet accessibility standards, I ensured that code meets the following standards:

### Use of semantic elements
![original html text](/assets/images/semantic-original.png)

The original text here did not follow accessibility standards because the non-sematic tags make it difficult for a screen reader to understand what the purpose and importance of each div element is. 

![modified html text](/assets/images/semantic-modified.png)

The header element very clearly states that this section of code will reside in the header section of the webpage. The nav element indicates that the item included in this section are navigational links.

### Ensuring that elements follow a logical structure

### Applying alt attributes to images

### Crafting a concise, descriptive title
