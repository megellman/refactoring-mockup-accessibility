# Refactoring Mockup Accessibility
![project landing page](/assets/images/mockup-page-screenshot.png)

## Description
This project was created to practice refactoring code to ensure that it meets accessibility standards. 

To meet accessibility standards, I ensured that code meets the following standards:
- Use of semantic elements
- Ensuring that elements follow a logical structure
- Applying alt attributes to images
- Crafting a concise, descriptive title
